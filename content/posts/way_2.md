# A index of layers

[OpenEmbedded Layer](https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/branch/master/layers/) is not a new tool, at least since 2015 I know that it exists. And the main purpose is to allow anyone from Yocto Project community to share their works that have been done around build new Yocto/OE layers.

# How to share

You can [submit](https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/submit/) any kind of layer, just answering a couple of questions about your new layer and send it.

The awesome part is that we can search by:

* layers
* recipes
* machines
* classes
* distros

I always take a look before start any new work around new layers.
